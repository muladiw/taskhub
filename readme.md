# Task Hub App

## Introduction

Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is **Muladi Wahyudin**.  
Iâ€™m developing **Task Hub**, a simple application to manage tasks with support for **Web** and **Mobile** platforms.

The app is built using **Go Fiber**, **Next.js**, and **Flutter** with carefully chosen libraries to ensure efficiency, security, and a smooth user experience.

## Tech Stack

### Backend (API - Golang with Fiber)

- **[Fiber](https://gofiber.io/)** â€“ A fast, lightweight web framework built on top of Fasthttp. I chose Fiber because it provides a simple Express-like API while delivering excellent performance for building RESTful APIs.
- **[golang-jwt](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt)** â€“ Handles JWT generation and validation for authentication. This ensures secure user sessions and API protection.
- **[godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv)** â€“ Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, making it easy to manage configurations without hardcoding secrets.
- **[validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator)** â€“ Provides powerful payload validation, reducing boilerplate checks and ensuring request integrity.
- **[GORM](https://gorm.io/)** â€“ An ORM that simplifies database interactions. It helps me write queries in Go code while still supporting complex SQL operations.

### Web (Next.js)

- **[React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)** â€“ Chosen for its powerful caching and background data synchronization. It makes API calls more efficient and keeps the UI up-to-date automatically.
- **[Hero UI](https://heroui.com/)** â€“ A customizable UI library that speeds up development with pre-built interactive components, while still allowing flexibility for custom designs.
- **[Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)** â€“ A lightweight and customizable icon library. Icons are an essential part of a task management app for better UX, and Lucide provides a modern, scalable solution.
- **[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)** â€“ Efficient form state management with minimal re-renders, which improves performance in complex forms.
- **[Zod](https://zod.dev/)** â€“ Used with React Hook Form for schema validation. It ensures form data is validated against strict rules before being submitted, reducing errors early.

### Mobile (Flutter)

- **[provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)** â€“ Chosen for state management. It simplifies data sharing across widgets, making the app easier to maintain and reducing boilerplate code compared to manual `setState`.
- **[flutter_secure_storage](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage)** â€“ Stores tokens and session data securely, which is crucial for authentication in mobile apps.
- **[flutter_svg](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg)** â€“ Enables rendering of SVG assets as widgets, making the UI more scalable and consistent across devices.
- **[http](https://pub.dev/packages/http)** â€“ Simple yet effective library for making RESTful API calls to the backend.
- **[flutter_dotenv](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dotenv)** â€“ Manages environment variables for different build environments (dev, staging, prod), making the app more maintainable.
